WebDevPhoenix provides a list of companies in Phoenix, Arizona that currently or might in the future, hire web developers. Even if a company isn't currently hiring, it's nice to know who's out there and what technologies they're using.

The site was created and is maintained by [@bradwestfall](http://twitter.com/bradwestfall). I welcome contributions and site improvements as pull requests on GitHub. Significant advancements will land you a mention on this page :)

## Upcoming Features and ideas

- Google Maps
- Charts
- Comments
- Job Listings (Maybe)

## Thank you

Special thanks to [Kris Faultner](https://github.com/kfaultner) for the help with adding a bunch of companies
