Connexta specializes in the integration of enterprise applications and services, bringing systems and data together for users. Committed to Free and Open Source Software, Connexta is the driving force behind the Codice Foundationâ€™s Distributed Data Framework (https://github.com/codice/ddf) and the ecosystem it supports.  At Connexta, we develop secure and extensible solutions that make data discoverable and accessible. Our solutions use DDF as a framework on which we deliver advanced capabilities to customers who need to rapidly collect, analyze, and act on intelligence across distributed, diverse, and dynamic data sources.

Connexta creates game-changing software to integrate enterprises that span across the world, bringing services and data together for users. We're guided by three concepts. CONNECT: know the tools, embrace the community and collaborate. And when a solution doesn't exist or needs more... CREATE: build and extend software, innovate, and develop talents. And when you have what you had once been looking for... CONTRIBUTE: help those that helped you and give back to employees and the community.
