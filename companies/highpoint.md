HighPoint focuses on providing a mobile front-end to the PeopleSoft application that many students use for enrollment, financial aid, grades, and transcripts. Our clients are colleges and universities around the U.S. and abroad. Our technology stack is PHP using a modified version of the CodeIgniter framework with XML requests made to the PeopleSoft application for data retrieval and storage. CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript round out our stack.
