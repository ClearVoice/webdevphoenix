<h1>Add yourself to the developer list</h1>

Adding a developer consists of creating a [Pull Request](https://github.com/bradwestfall/webdevphoenix/blob/master/contribute-developer.md) on our GitHub page. The site is built on GitHub Pages using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator. So all you have to do is create a YAML/Markdown file and submit your pull request.
